# Stat 154 Final Project
The purpose of this project is to build models on the Census Income Data Set.
 The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.
## Data Set
-----------------------
The data set is in the `data` folder. It contains `adult.data` for training and `adult.test` for testing. It describes 15 variables on a sample of individuals from the US Census database. 

## Model
-----------------------
The code of all the models we used for training is the Rmd file in the `R` folder. 
-Classification Tree
-Bagged Tree
-Random Forest


## Result
--------------------
The classification tree is the strongest classifier of the three methods. We built three models with optimal tuning parameters, important features , training accuracy rate, ROC curve, and AUC. Finally, we validate the best supervised classifier on the test set.The full for this project is the  Pdf file in the `report` folder.
